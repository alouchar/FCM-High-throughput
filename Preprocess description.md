### Description

Exploration of density curve extracted from the histograms indicates you whether your data should be transformed or not. Here, we display the same histograms as previously and give you the choice of the transformation to apply to your data.

Transformation are particularly usefull when data spanned several order of magnitude. In phytoplankton samples, we consider it is not usefull for monoculture analysis while I might be highly recommanded for natural communities.

Available transformation are:

-   Log10

-   Square-root

-   Arcsinh

-   Logicle

-   Biexponential

The export button allows you to export your dataset transformed into .csv format
