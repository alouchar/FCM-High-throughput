### Explanations

Some definition to help interpreting the histograms. Typically, distribution are by Kurtosis and Skewness.

-   Kurtosis:

*Kurtosis* is a measure of the tailedness of a distribution. Tailedness is how often outliers occur in the measurements. Distributions can be leptokurtic (high kurtosis; fat tails caused by many outliers), platykurtic (low kurtosis; thin tails because of few outliers) or mesokurtic (moderate kurtosis; medium tails caused by medium number of outliers).

-   Skewness:

*Skewness* is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution. A symmetrical distribution is non-skewed. A left asymmetry (long tail on left side) produces negative skewness. A right asymmetry (long tail on right side) produces positive skewness.
